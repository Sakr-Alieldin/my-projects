• Creating a robotic arm on wheels from A to Z,the robot has to
follow a black line on the floor, get to every object on the map,
recognize the object, pick it up and deliver it to it’s intended
placement
• Team of 7 people
• 3D modeling and printing the chassis and the robotic arm
• Choosing the electrical and mechanical components (motors,
wheels, arduino, sonic sensors and infrared sensors) and attaching
them to the chassis
• PID error regulation to allow the robot to follow the line smoothly
without risking it leaving the line
• Coding a simulation and then coding the arduino to make the
robot entirely autonomous, optimizing the code’s logic to minimize
the time of the task.
• The only group out of 6 groups to get 20/20 for the prototype
